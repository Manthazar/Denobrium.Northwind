The webapi project is the first and key project in this demonstration sandbox. Alternative API providers may be existent, but their primary purpose remains portability and multi-platform indications. 
Said that WebApi is not considered by me as a must have Thing, but a great starter for dotnet projects. 

The underlying backend is however coded not under the assumption that ASP.NET WEBAPI is actually used.
